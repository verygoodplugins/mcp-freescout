## Quick Start (Recommended)

The easiest way to use this MCP server is with `npx`:

### With Claude Desktop

Add this to your Claude Desktop settings (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "freescout": {
      "command": "npx @verygoodplugins/mcp-freescout@latest",
      "env": {
        "FREESCOUT_URL": "https://your-freescout-domain.com",
        "FREESCOUT_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### With Cursor IDE

Add this to your Cursor MCP settings:

**Method 1: Via Cursor Settings UI**
1. Open Cursor Settings (Cmd/Ctrl + ,)
2. Search for "MCP" 
3. Click "Edit in settings.json"
4. Add the MCP server configuration

**Method 2: Manual Configuration**
Add this to your Cursor settings.json or create `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "freescout": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["@verygoodplugins/mcp-freescout@latest"],
        "env": {
          "FREESCOUT_URL": "https://your-freescout-domain.com",
          "FREESCOUT_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
          "WORKING_DIRECTORY": "${workspaceFolder}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

That's it! The server will automatically use your current workspace directory for Git operations.

Thank you for reporting the HighLevel OAuth authorization issue! Your experience with the EngageBay LiveChat plugin conflict has been really valuable.

Based on what we learned from your case, I've added a new plugin conflict detection system to WP Fusion. In the next update (v3.46.7), users will see:

üîç **Plugin Conflict Detection**
- Automatic detection of known conflicting plugins  
- Warning messages before HighLevel authorization
- Clear guidance when conflicts are detected

This should prevent the confusion you experienced and help other users avoid similar issues.

The update should be available within the next few weeks. Thanks for your patience and for helping us improve the plugin!

Best regards,
Jack`

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `FREESCOUT_URL` | Your FreeScout instance URL | `https://support.example.com` |
| `FREESCOUT_API_KEY` | FreeScout API key | `your-api-key-here` |

### Optional Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `FREESCOUT_DEFAULT_USER_ID` | Default user ID for assignments | `1` |
| `WORKING_DIRECTORY` | Base directory for Git operations | Current working directory¬π |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | GitHub repository (owner/repo) | Auto-detected using `gh`¬≤ |

¬π **Note**: Automatically uses the current project/workspace directory. Only set this if you need to work on a different directory.

¬≤ **Note**: The server automatically detects the GitHub repository using GitHub CLI (`gh`). Requires `gh` to be installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`). Only set `GITHUB_REPO` if you need to override the auto-detection.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "freescout": {
      "command": "npx @verygoodplugins/mcp-freescout@latest",
      "env": {
        "FREESCOUT_URL": "https://support.example.com",
        "FREESCOUT_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "FREESCOUT_DEFAULT_USER_ID": "2",
        "WORKING_DIRECTORY": "/path/to/specific/project",
        "GITHUB_REPO": "owner/repo"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### FreeScout API Setup

1. Log into your FreeScout instance as an administrator
2. Navigate to Manage ‚Üí API Keys
3. Create a new API key with appropriate permissions:
   - View conversations
   - Update conversations
   - Create threads (for notes)

## Best Practices

### Ticket Analysis
- Always analyze tickets before implementing fixes
- Check for third-party limitations before attempting fixes
- Verify reproducibility with team notes

### Git Workflow
- Use worktrees for parallel development
- Clean up worktrees after PR creation
- Keep branch names descriptive

### Customer Communication
- Generate draft replies for review
- Include fix descriptions in customer communications
- Use explanatory replies for non-bug issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### API Connection Errors
- Verify your FreeScout URL includes the protocol (https://)
- Check API key permissions in FreeScout
- Ensure your FreeScout instance has API access enabled

#### Git Worktree Errors
- Ensure Git is installed and accessible
- Verify the working directory is a Git repository (defaults to current directory)
- Check that the base branch exists
- If needed, explicitly set WORKING_DIRECTORY to your Git repository path

#### Ticket Parsing Issues
- The server accepts ticket IDs, numbers, and full URLs
- URLs are automatically parsed to extract ticket IDs
- Numeric inputs are treated as ticket IDs
